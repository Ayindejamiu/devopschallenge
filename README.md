##Weather APP Project â€“ DevOps Challenge (Week 1)
Project Overview
In this project, I developed a weather application using Python. The application utilizes the OpenWeather API and AWS S3 for data storage. An environment was setup and data collected real time from the weather application, the data was transformed and structured then it will be saved in AWS s3 bueket as a json file. 

Key Components
1. OpenWeather API: OpenWeather allows us to connect using an API to get the current weather for any region.

2. AWS S3: After the data has been collected and transformed we store it in AWS S3 for securely. 
3. Python & DevOps Practices
